# Cosmic NPM module (dashboard v1)
## IMPORTANT
This package connects to projects on the old Cosmic dashboard and API v2 only. To connect to projects on the [new Cosmic dashboard](https://beta.cosmicjs.com/signup) and API v3 use the [Cosmic JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmicjs/sdk).

## Install

Install the Cosmic NPM module:

```bash
pnpm install cosmicjs
# OR
yarn add cosmicjs
# OR
npm install cosmicjs
```

## Import

Import Cosmic into your app:

```jsx
const Cosmic = require("cosmicjs")
const api = Cosmic()
```

## Connect

In your [Cosmic admin dashboard](https://app.cosmicjs.com/login) go to _Your Bucket > Settings > API Access_ and get your Bucket slug and read key then set the variables in your app to connect to your Bucket:

```jsx
const bucket = api.bucket({
  slug: "YOUR_BUCKET_SLUG",
  read_key: "YOUR_BUCKET_READ_KEY",
})
```

## Get content

Delivering content to your app is simple using the `objects.find` method.

**Get multiple Objects**

Use the `objects.find` method and set the `type` property to any Object Type slug. Additional options noted below.

```jsx
const data = await bucket.objects.find({
  type: "products" // Object Type slug
})
.props("title,slug,metadata") // response properties
.limit(10) // number of Objects to be returned
```

**Get single Object by slug**

Use the `objects.find` method and set the `slug` property to any Object slug.

```jsx
const data = await bucket.objects.find({
  type: "pages", // Object Type slug
  slug: "home", // Object slug
  locale: "en", // optional, if localization set on Objects
})
.props("title,slug,metadata") // response properties
```
